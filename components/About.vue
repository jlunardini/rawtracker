    I created DenimTracker because I am have two loves: raw denim and metrics. I
    have terrible memory when concerning the temporal, and as such, have created
    this app to help myself keep track of my jeans, how long I have owned each
    pair, how many days each pair has been worn, and to have a visual record
    documenting those sweet sweet fades.
